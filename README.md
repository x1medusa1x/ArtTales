# ArtTales
A platform where artists can share their artworks and users can interact with them.

I created this application to not only test my limits when it comes to new technologies web-wise, but also to see how people would use it and interact with it.
It is also a great place to learn from, since there can always be improvements made.


This is a submission for Web Application Development Assignments.
